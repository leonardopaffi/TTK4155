## TTK4155 - Industrial and Embedded Computer Systems Design
### Term project - Ping-pong game with distributed embedded control system

#### Course content:
Design of embedded computer systems. Computer architectures and system components for embedded and industrial applications. Microcontrollers and specialized microprocessors. Parallel and serial bus systems. Datacommunication in industrial environments. Analog/digital interfaces.


In this project, we as a team of four were to create a ping-pong boardgame, by using hardware components and develop software for the microcontrollers creating a fully functional embedded computer system. The final product can be seen fully assembled below. A bit messy, as we had a lack of cables but fully functional.
